DESCRIPTION::
An easy way to load a bunch of audio files into easily accessible collections of buffers in Supercollider. Great for sample libraries.
This class loads the sound files at the root of a folder into the array, ignoring any subfolders

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new

ARGUMENT:: server
Server to load the buffers to

ARGUMENT:: path
Path to folder of sound files to load (string)

ARGUMENT:: channel
Optional - uses Buffer's readChannel method to load specified channel of audio file (for instance,
for a folder of audio files with differing numbers of channels)


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: checkHeader

Check the extension of a file to see if it's an audio file.
Supported file types: aiff, wav, wave, riff, sun, next, sd2, ircam, raw, mat4, mat5, paf, svx, nist, voc, w64, pvf, xi, htk, sds, avr, flac, caf

ARGUMENT:: path
The path of the file to check (as a string)

returns:: Boolean


METHOD:: init

ARGUMENT:: server

ARGUMENT:: path

ARGUMENT:: channel

METHOD:: loadBuffersToArray

ARGUMENT:: path

ARGUMENT:: channel

returns:: Array


EXAMPLES::

code::

b = BufFolders(s, "path/to/808/sample/pack");

b[\808bd]; // A list of all 808 kick drums in the 808bd folder in the supplied path
b[\808hh]; // A list of all 808 high hats in the 808hh folder in the supplied path

b[\root]; // Contains all of the audio files at the root level (ie outside of the directories at path)

c = BufFiles(s, "path/to/808/sample/pack/808sd");

c; // Now this is just an array of files from the 808sd folder above

// Play using a pbind 
Pbind(
    \instrument, \bufferPlayer, // (you need to make a bufferPlayer synth to make this work
    \buffer, Pxrand(b[\808bd], inf), // Randomly choose from the kick drum samples
    \dur, Pseq([0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.125],inf) // A terrible rhythm
).play;
